## Week 9 - Monday 24
 
Self-learning (Unet, think about what could be the bottleneck) and transfer learning encode.

Train-validation split (proportion, idependent and identical - density color), check variation.

We can use stage 1. 

Pre-processing:
 - differnet sizes: padding, cropping (random crops, augmentation), scaling (side effects)
 - different colors: gray scale

For presentation:
 - data (what to take into account, data tranformation)
 - different architectures: explain each, comparing a them

For next week:
 - get a baseline network 'hello world' and data split
